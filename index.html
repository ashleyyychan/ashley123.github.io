                <p>Hello, My name is Ashley Chan and this is my personal website.<br>

I am a Chinese, Maori and Samoan girl who has lived in New Zealand all 15 years of my life.<br>

This is a small website about who I am to help you learn more about me, my culture and my education. There is also a page with all my contacts if you want to get a hold of me.</p>

                <h4>QINGMING/CHING MING FESTIVAL</h4>
                <p>Qingming or Ching Ming is a festival that is celebrated by ethnic Chinese in mainland China, Hong Kong. Macau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, Combodia, Indonesia, Phillipines, Thailand, and Vietnam. This festival is also known as Tomb-sweeping day. Qingming usually lasts around 15 days. This is a cultural tradition that my family does once in a while to show respect to the ones who have passed away in our family. Normally we would burn paper money, joss joss sticks and clean the dirt and dust off the tomb stones. We burn paper money because it is like we are sending money to them in heaven.</p>

                <h4>SIVA SAMOA</h4>
                <p>Siva Samoa in english means samoan dance. This traditional dance is very important in Samoan culture as the hands, head, legs, body movement all tell a story of someones life. Samoa has other dances that are apart of their culture as well like Siva Afi which is a fire dance and Siva Ili which is a fan dance. When I was 9/10 years old, I remember doing a Siva in front of all my samoan family. During the dance you have people cheering, uncles slapping their chests and aunties and cousins dancing by your side. While I was dancing I was drenched in baby oil for my family members to come up and stick money to my skin because I was dancing to fundraise for our village, Falefa in Samoa.</p>

                <h4>HĀNGI</h4>
                <p>A hāngi is a traditional māori method of cooking food using a pit oven and heated rocks. A pit oven is a pit in the gorund that traps heat to bake/smoke/steam the food for at least four hours. This is still a popular method that is used today to cook large baskets of food. Traditional foods that were cooked in the ovens were usually fish and kumara/sweet potato. Nowadays, people like to cook pork, lamb, potato, pumpkin and cabbage. Originally they would wrap the food in flax leaves but now we use mutton cloth, tin foil and wire baskets because they are easily accessible. We like to get together and prepare everything needed for that hāngi as a family.</p>

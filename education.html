                <p>I am Currently attending Botany Downs Secondary College (BDSC as a year 10). When I was younger, I spent year 1-8 at a school named Redoubt North School (RNS) which has an intermediate and primary. At RNS I did orienteering, netball, softball, road patrol, brass band and PEERS which is when you work with the younger year levels during lunch time. By year 8 I was reading at the same level as a 15 year old and achieving the highest math grades in my class. Because I played in the brass band I know how to read treble clef sheet music and play the cornet. In my free time I also play piano and am learning how to play guitar. Now at BDSC I am still doing netball and taking Media Studies, DIT (Digital Technology) and Japanese. I am also taking accelerate maths which means were learning year 11 maths and doing NCEA 1 this year (2023).</p>
